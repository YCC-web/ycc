# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my **first post** written in MDX.

## What is MDX?

MDX lets you use JSX in markdown documents. You can import and use React components:

<Button>Click Me!</Button>

## Code Example

Here's some code with syntax highlighting:
```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## Features

- ✨ Markdown syntax
- ⚛️ React components
- 🎨 Syntax highlighting
- 🔗 Auto-linked headings

Pretty cool, right?
